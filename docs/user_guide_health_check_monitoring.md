## Understanding Health Check Monitoring

### What is Health Check Monitoring?
Health check monitoring is a system for tracking system status and its components to ensure stable operation. In the context of GlobalScope MultiFrame, this includes:
- **API Monitoring**: Tracking API service status
- **Redis Monitoring**: Tracking Redis connection
- **Component Monitoring**: Tracking status of all system components
- **Notifications**: Automatic notifications about issues
- **Reporting**: Generation of system status reports

### Health Check Monitoring Features
The health check monitoring system offers several key capabilities:
- **Automatic Checks**: Regular system status checks
- **Detailed Analysis**: Deep analysis of system components
- **Notifications**: Instant notifications about issues
- **Check History**: Storage of all check history
- **Report Export**: Export of reports for further analysis
