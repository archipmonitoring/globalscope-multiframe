## Test Markers

Tests are marked with the following markers:

- `@pytest.mark.asyncio` - Async tests
- `@pytest.mark.unit` - Unit tests
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Integration tests
- `@pytest.mark.performance` - Performance tests
- `@pytest.mark.regression` - Regression tests

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed to run in CI/CD pipelines. Configure your CI system to run:

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

## Test Reporting

Test results are displayed in the console. For detailed HTML reports, use:

```bash
pytest tests/ --html=reports/test_report.html --self-contained-html
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests

1. **Use descriptive test names**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested
2. **Follow AAA pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert
3. **Test one thing**: Each test should verify one specific behavior
4. **Use fixtures**: Reuse setup code with pytest fixtures
5. **Mock external dependencies**: Isolate the code under test

### Test Data

1. **Use realistic test data**: Test data should reflect real-world scenarios
2. **Clean up after tests**: Ensure tests don't leave side effects
3. **Use parameterized tests**: Test multiple scenarios with the same test logic

### Performance Considerations

1. **Keep tests fast**: Tests should run quickly to encourage frequent execution
2. **Use appropriate markers**: Mark slow tests appropriately
3. **Parallel execution**: Tests should be designed to run in parallel when possible

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import errors**: Ensure PYTHONPATH includes the src directory
2. **Async test failures**: Use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` for async tests
3. **Mock issues**: Verify all dependencies are properly mocked

### Debugging Tests

To run tests in debug mode:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v -s --pdb
```

## Test Coverage Goals

The testing framework aims for the following coverage targets:

- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: 85%+ integration coverage
- **Performance Tests**: 80%+ performance-critical code
- **Regression Tests**: 100% existing functionality coverage

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Create a new test file in the `tests/` directory
2. Follow the naming convention `test_<module_name>.py`
3. Use appropriate markers
4. Add the test to the test runner script

### Updating Tests

1. Update tests when functionality changes
2. Add regression tests for bug fixes
3. Review test coverage regularly

## Conclusion

This comprehensive testing framework ensures GlobalScope MultiFrame 11.0 maintains high quality and reliability while providing confidence in the system's functionality, performance, and compatibility.
