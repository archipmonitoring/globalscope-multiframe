## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Process simulation fails to converge
- **Cause**: Inconsistent parameter values or unstable models
- **Solution**: Review parameter ranges, check model validity, and simplify complex interactions

#### Issue: Yield predictions are lower than expected
- **Cause**: Overly conservative assumptions or unaccounted process variations
- **Solution**: Refine variation models, adjust process windows, and validate assumptions

#### Issue: Process steps exceed equipment capabilities
- **Cause**: Mismatch between process requirements and available tools
- **Solution**: Modify process parameters or select different equipment templates

#### Issue: Design rule violations in generated layouts
- **Cause**: Inconsistent design rules or incorrect constraint definitions
- **Solution**: Review and synchronize design rules across all process layers

#### Issue: Simulation results don't match expected behavior
- **Cause**: Model inaccuracies or incorrect boundary conditions
- **Solution**: Validate models against reference data and review simulation setup
