## Understanding the BCI Interface

### What is the BCI Interface?
The BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) is a platform control system using neural signals that allows users to perform tasks without using traditional interfaces. In the context of GlobalScope MultiFrame, this includes:
- **Neural Design**: Creating chips using neural signals
- **BCI Quests**: Initiating learning quests through neural signals
- **BCI Tours**: Interactive platform tours
- **High Accuracy**: Accurate recognition of neural commands
- **Direct Control**: Control without physical intervention

### BCI Interface Features
The BCI system offers several key capabilities:
- **Neural Signal Recognition**: Accurate recognition of neural commands
- **Neural Design**: Chip creation through neural signals
- **BCI Quests**: Initiation of learning tasks
- **Adaptive Learning**: Improved recognition over time
- **Security**: Protected neural signal transmission

### 3. BCI Calibration
Perform BCI calibration to improve recognition:
1. Click the "BCI Calibration" button
2. Perform control neural actions
3. Wait for calibration completion
4. Check recognition accuracy
5. Repeat calibration if necessary

## Using Neural Design

### 1. Activating Neural Design
Activate chip design through neural signals:
1. Mentally imagine the command "start design"
2. Wait for activation confirmation
3. Focus on chip parameters
4. Check recognized parameters
5. Confirm design start

### 2. Specifying Chip Parameters
Specify chip parameters through neural signals:
1. Focus on the chip type (e.g., "quantum processor")
2. Imagine the number of cores (e.g., "4 cores")
3. Focus on frequency (e.g., "3.5 gigahertz")
4. Add additional parameters if needed
5. Confirm parameters through neural signals

### 3. Monitoring the Design Process
Monitor the neural design process:
1. Receive progress updates through BCI
2. Check design status
3. Receive completion notifications
4. Review design results
5. Make adjustments through neural signals

## Using BCI Quests

### 1. Initiating BCI Quests
Initiate learning quests through neural signals:
1. Focus on the command "start quest"
2. Imagine the quest type
3. Confirm quest start
4. Follow neural instructions
5. Complete tasks according to instructions

### 2. Neural Quest Management
Manage active quests through neural signals:
1. Check quest status through neural signals
2. Receive hints through neural signals
3. Complete quests through neural signals
4. Check completion progress
5. Receive rewards for completion

### 3. BCI Tours
Use BCI platform tours:
1. Focus on the command "start tour"
2. Follow neural instructions
3. Review platform information
4. Interact with tour elements
5. Complete the tour through neural signals

## Best Practices

### Equipment Setup
1. Use quality BCI equipment for better recognition
2. Ensure a calm environment
3. Regularly update BCI equipment drivers
4. Adjust signal filtering parameters
5. Check equipment operation before use

### Using BCI
1. Relax before using BCI
2. Focus on one command at a time
3. Don't rush when executing commands
4. Use pauses between commands
5. Check recognized commands before execution

### Maximizing Effectiveness
1. Regularly calibrate BCI
2. Use BCI for repetitive tasks
3. Combine BCI with other interfaces
4. Learn neural shortcuts
5. Keep up with BCI feature updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Neural signals not recognized
- **Cause**: BCI equipment issues or poor concentration
- **Solution**: Check BCI equipment, ensure calm, perform calibration

#### Issue: Incorrect command recognition
- **Cause**: Insufficient calibration or poor concentration
- **Solution**: Perform recalibration, focus better, use standard commands

#### Issue: Command execution delay
- **Cause**: High system load or network issues
- **Solution**: Check system load, check network connection, contact support

#### Issue: BCI interface not responding
- **Cause**: Service issues or technical errors
- **Solution**: Restart BCI service, update client, contact support

#### Issue: Low recognition accuracy
- **Cause**: Insufficient system training or concentration issues
- **Solution**: Perform additional calibration, improve concentration, contact support
