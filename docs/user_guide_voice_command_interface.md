# User Guide: Voice Command Interface

*Documentation also available in Ukrainian: [user_guide_voice_command_interface_uk.md](user_guide_voice_command_interface_uk.md)*

## Overview
This guide explains how to use the voice command interface in GlobalScope MultiFrame to control the platform and perform tasks by voice.

## Prerequisites
- Completed [Platform Overview and Architecture](user_guide_platform_overview.md)
- Basic understanding of voice control concepts
- System account access
- Access to microphone or voice equipment

## Understanding the Voice Command Interface

### What is the Voice Command Interface?
The voice command interface is a platform control system using voice commands that allows users to perform tasks without using traditional interfaces. In the context of GlobalScope MultiFrame, this includes:
- **Voice Design**: Creating chips through voice commands
- **Voice Quests**: Initiating learning quests by voice
- **Voice Assistant**: Interactive HoloMisha assistant
- **Language Recognition**: Support for Ukrainian and English languages
- **High Accuracy**: 95% command recognition accuracy

### Voice Command Interface Features
The voice command system offers several key capabilities:
- **Command Recognition**: Accurate recognition of voice commands
- **Voice Design**: Chip creation by voice
- **Voice Quests**: Initiation of learning tasks
- **Adaptive Learning**: Improved recognition over time
- **Multilingual Support**: Support for Ukrainian and English languages

## Setting Up the Voice Interface

### 1. Accessing the Voice Interface
Accessing voice interface features:
1. Log into your GlobalScope MultiFrame account
2. Navigate to the "Interfaces" module in the main menu
3. Click on "Voice Commands" in the left sidebar
4. Check the voice recognition status
5. Prepare the microphone for use

### 2. Microphone Setup
Set up the microphone for optimal operation:
1. Check microphone connection to the system
2. Adjust microphone sensitivity level
3. Check ambient noise level
4. Conduct a test recognition
5. Adjust noise reduction parameters

### 3. Voice Calibration
Perform voice calibration to improve recognition:
1. Click the "Voice Calibration" button
2. Speak control phrases
3. Wait for calibration completion
4. Check recognition accuracy
5. Repeat calibration if necessary

## Using Voice Design

### 1. Activating Voice Design
Activate voice chip design:
1. Say the key phrase "HoloMisha, start design"
2. Wait for activation confirmation
3. Speak chip parameters
4. Check recognized parameters
5. Confirm design start

### 2. Specifying Chip Parameters
Specify chip parameters by voice commands:
1. Speak the chip type (e.g., "quantum processor")
2. Specify the number of cores (e.g., "4 cores")
3. Specify frequency (e.g., "3.5 gigahertz")
4. Add additional parameters if needed
5. Confirm parameters by voice

### 3. Monitoring the Design Process
Monitor the voice design process:
1. Receive voice updates on progress
2. Check design status
3. Receive completion notifications
4. Review design results
5. Make adjustments by voice commands

## Using Voice Quests

### 1. Initiating Voice Quests
Initiate learning quests by voice commands:
1. Say "HoloMisha, start quest"
2. Specify the quest type by voice
3. Confirm quest start
4. Follow voice instructions
5. Complete tasks according to instructions

### 2. Voice Quest Management
Manage active quests by voice commands:
1. Check quest status by voice
2. Receive hints by voice commands
3. Complete quests by voice commands
4. Check completion progress
5. Receive rewards for completion

### 3. Voice Hints
Use voice hints during quests:
1. Say "HoloMisha, hint" to get help
2. Receive voice hints
3. Ask questions by voice
4. Receive explanations by voice
5. Continue quest execution

## Best Practices

### Equipment Setup
1. Use a quality microphone for better recognition
2. Ensure a quiet environment
3. Regularly update audio equipment drivers
4. Adjust noise reduction parameters
5. Check microphone operation before use

### Using Voice Commands
1. Speak clearly and distinctly
2. Use standard command formulations
3. Don't rush when executing commands
4. Use pauses between commands
5. Check recognized commands before execution

### Maximizing Effectiveness
1. Regularly calibrate your voice
2. Use voice commands for repetitive tasks
3. Combine voice commands with other interfaces
4. Learn voice shortcuts
5. Keep up with voice feature updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Voice not recognized
- **Cause**: Microphone issues or noisy environment
- **Solution**: Check microphone, ensure quiet, perform calibration

#### Issue: Incorrect command recognition
- **Cause**: Insufficient calibration or unclear speech
- **Solution**: Perform recalibration, speak more clearly, use standard formulations

#### Issue: Command execution delay
- **Cause**: High system load or network issues
- **Solution**: Check system load, check network connection, contact support

#### Issue: Voice assistant not responding
- **Cause**: Service issues or technical errors
- **Solution**: Restart voice service, update client, contact support

#### Issue: Low recognition accuracy
- **Cause**: Insufficient system training or accent
- **Solution**: Perform additional calibration, use standard speech, contact support
