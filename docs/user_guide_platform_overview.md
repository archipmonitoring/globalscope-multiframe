### 7. API Module
The API Module provides RESTful interface for all system functionality:
- **Main App**: FastAPI application
- **API Config**: API router registration
- **Routers**: API endpoints organized by functionality

## System Architecture

### Microservices Architecture
GlobalScope MultiFrame 11.0 follows a microservices architecture with loosely coupled components:
- Each module operates independently
- Modules communicate through well-defined APIs
- Services can be scaled independently

### Event-Driven Architecture
The system uses an event bus for decoupled communication:
- Events are published to the event bus
- Services subscribe to relevant events
- This prevents circular dependencies

### Data Storage
The system uses Redis as its primary data store:
- User profiles and authentication data
- Generated chip drivers
- Collaboration sessions
- Chip design processes
- Web3 NFT records
- Learning quests

### Security Architecture
The security architecture includes multiple layers of protection:
- Quantum-level firewall
- Zero-day vulnerability scanning
- Security event logging
- Access control

## Getting Started

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Redis server
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation
1. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Start Redis server:
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

3. Initialize demo data (optional):
   ```bash
   python init_demo_data.py
   ```

4. Start the API server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Docker Deployment
For containerized deployment:
```bash
cd src
docker-compose up -d
```

## API Endpoints
The system provides a comprehensive REST API with endpoints organized by functional areas:
- System Management
- Authentication
- Chip Design
- Analytics
- Security
- Simulation
- Collaboration
- Community
- Marketplace
- Integration
- Administration

Full API documentation is available at:
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
- Use connection pooling for database connections
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use asynchronous processing for I/O-bound operations

### Security
- Always validate user inputs
- Use authentication for protected endpoints
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Log security events for auditing

### Scalability
- Design services to be stateless
- Use load balancing for high-traffic services
- Implement auto-scaling for variable workloads

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Redis Connection Failed**: Ensure Redis server is running
2. **API Endpoints Not Responding**: Check if the API server is running
3. **Authentication Failed**: Verify username and token
