## Overview
This guide walks you through the process of creating your first chip design project in GlobalScope MultiFrame 11.0. By following these steps, you'll learn how to set up a new project, configure basic settings, and begin working with the platform's core chip design tools.

## Prerequisites
- A verified GlobalScope MultiFrame account
- Completed [Account Setup and Authentication](user_guide_account_setup_auth.md)

## Creating Your First Project

### 1. Access the Project Dashboard
1. Log in to the GlobalScope MultiFrame platform
2. From the main dashboard, click on the "Projects" tab in the navigation menu
3. You'll see an overview of any existing projects (if applicable)

### 2. Initiate New Project Creation
1. Click the "Create New Project" button (usually located in the top right corner)
2. A project creation wizard will appear with several configuration steps

### 3. Project Details Setup
Fill in the following information:
- **Project Name**: Give your project a descriptive name (e.g., "First Test Chip Design")
- **Project Description**: Briefly describe the purpose of your project
- **Project Type**: Select from available options:
  - Digital Circuit Design
  - Analog Circuit Design
  - Mixed-Signal Design
  - RF Design
  - Memory Design
- **Technology Node**: Choose the target fabrication process (e.g., 7nm, 5nm, 3nm)
- **Design Complexity**: Select Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced

### 4. Team and Collaboration Settings
- **Project Visibility**: Choose between Private, Team, or Public
- **Team Members**: Add collaborators by entering their email addresses
- **Permissions**: Set access levels for team members (Read, Write, Admin)

### 5. Template Selection
Choose a project template to accelerate your workflow:
- **Blank Project**: Start from scratch
- **Basic Digital Design**: Pre-configured for simple digital circuits
- **AI Accelerator**: Optimized for machine learning chip designs
- **IoT Sensor**: Designed for low-power sensor applications
- **RF Transceiver**: Pre-configured for radio frequency applications

### 6. Resource Allocation
Configure computing resources for your project:
- **CPU Cores**: Select number of CPU cores (default: 4)
- **Memory**: Allocate RAM (default: 8GB)
- **Storage**: Set storage limit (default: 50GB)
- **AI Acceleration**: Enable GPU/TPU resources if needed

### 7. Advanced Configuration (Optional)
- **Quantum Simulation**: Enable quantum-level simulation features
- **Zero-Defect Engine**: Activate advanced defect prevention
- **Security Settings**: Configure encryption and access controls
- **Backup Schedule**: Set automatic backup frequency

### 8. Review and Create
1. Review all project settings
2. Click "Create Project" to finalize the creation process
3. The system will initialize your project environment

## Project Initialization Process

### Environment Setup
After clicking "Create Project," the system will:
1. Provision computing resources
2. Initialize version control system
3. Set up project directory structure
4. Configure AI engines and analytics tools
5. Deploy security measures
6. Create initial backup

This process typically takes 1-3 minutes depending on selected resources.

### Initial Project Structure
Your new project will include the following directories:
- **/design**: Main design files and schematics
- **/simulation**: Simulation models and results
- **/verification**: Testing and validation files
- **/documentation**: Project-specific documentation
- **/collaboration**: Team communication and shared resources
- **/analytics**: Performance data and reports

## Getting Started with Your Project

### 1. Access Your Project Workspace
1. From the Projects dashboard, click on your newly created project
2. The project workspace will load with multiple tabs:
   - Overview
   - Design Studio
   - Simulation
   - Analytics
   - Collaboration
   - Settings

### 2. Explore the Design Studio
The Design Studio is where you'll spend most of your time:
- **Canvas**: Main design area for creating schematics
- **Component Library**: Pre-built components and IP blocks
- **Properties Panel**: Configure component properties
- **Tool Palette**: Design tools and instruments
- **Hierarchy View**: Project structure and organization

### 3. Create Your First Design Element
1. Select a component from the Component Library
2. Drag it onto the Canvas
3. Configure its properties in the Properties Panel
4. Connect components using wiring tools
5. Save your work using Ctrl+S or the Save button

## Best Practices

### Project Organization
1. Use descriptive names for all design elements
2. Create logical folder structures in the project directory
3. Maintain detailed documentation for complex designs
4. Regularly commit changes to version control
5. Use meaningful tags and labels for project elements

### Resource Management
1. Start with default resource allocations
2. Monitor resource usage in the Analytics tab
3. Scale resources up or down as needed
4. Set budget alerts to prevent unexpected costs
5. Clean up temporary files regularly

### Collaboration Guidelines
1. Establish clear roles and responsibilities for team members
2. Use the collaboration tools for communication
3. Document design decisions in the project wiki
4. Review and approve changes through proper workflows
5. Conduct regular project status meetings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Project creation fails with resource allocation error
- **Cause**: Insufficient account resources or quota limits
- **Solution**: Reduce resource allocation or upgrade your account plan

#### Issue: Long initialization time
- **Cause**: High resource allocation or system load
- **Solution**: Wait for completion or reduce resource allocation for faster setup

#### Issue: Missing template options
- **Cause**: Account type limitations
- **Solution**: Upgrade to Professional or Enterprise account for additional templates

#### Issue: Unable to access project workspace
- **Cause**: Network connectivity issues or browser compatibility
- **Solution**: Check internet connection, try a different browser, or clear browser cache

#### Issue: Permission errors when adding team members
- **Cause**: Insufficient permissions or invalid email addresses
- **Solution**: Verify your account permissions and ensure team member emails are correct
