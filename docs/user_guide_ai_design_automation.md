4. Click the "Optimize Design" button
5. Wait for the optimization process to complete (typically 1-2 minutes)
6. Review the optimization results and recommendations

### 2. Creating New Optimized Design
Create a new design using automatic optimization:
1. Navigate to the "Chip Design" module from the main navigation
2. Click the "New Project" button
3. Enter the base design parameters
4. Activate the "Automatic AI Optimization" option
5. Click "Create Project"
6. The system will automatically create an optimized design

### 3. Version Comparison
Compare original and optimized designs:
1. Open the project in the design editor
2. Click on "Version Comparison" in the menu
3. Select the original and optimized versions
4. View the detailed comparison table
5. Analyze improvements in energy efficiency, performance, and other parameters

## Analyzing Results

### 1. Optimization Metrics
Understanding optimization results:
- **Energy Efficiency**: Measured in femtojoules per operation (fJ/op)
- **Defect Rate**: Percentage likelihood of defects
- **Performance**: Improvements in clock speed and throughput
- **Die Area**: Changes in chip dimensions
- **Heat Dissipation**: Reduction in heat generation after optimization

### 2. Improvement Recommendations
Using intelligent recommendations:
- **Architectural Changes**: Recommendations for architecture modifications
- **Component Parameters**: Optimal parameter values
- **Connection Topology**: Improvements to connection schemes
- **Block Placement**: Optimal placement of functional blocks
- **Timing Parameters**: Recommendations for timing

### 3. Optimization History
Tracking optimization history:
- **Change History**: Complete history of all project optimizations
- **Results Comparison**: Comparison of different optimization effectiveness
- **Improvement Trends**: Analysis of overall improvement trends
- **Report Export**: Export detailed optimization reports

## Best Practices

### Using AI Design Automation
1. Use automatic optimization at early design stages
2. Regularly optimize designs during development
3. Compare optimization results with the original design
4. Use system recommendations for further refinement
5. Keep optimization history for progress analysis

### Interpreting Results
1. Focus on key metrics: energy efficiency, defects, performance
2. Critically analyze system recommendations but consider them
3. Compare results with industry standards
4. Document improvements for future projects
5. Share results with the team for collective learning

### Integration with Other Tools
1. Combine automatic optimization with [Zero-Defect Engineering](user_guide_zero_defect.md)
2. Use optimization results for [Driver Generation](user_guide_driver_generation.md)
3. Integrate optimized designs with [IP Block Generation](user_guide_ip_block_generation.md)
4. Use analytics for [AI Trend Analysis](user_guide_ai_trend_analysis.md)
5. Apply strategies from [AI Strategy Engine](user_guide_ai_strategy_engine.md)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Optimization doesn't provide significant improvements
- **Cause**: Design is already well-optimized or has specific constraints
- **Solution**: Check input parameters and constraints. Try different optimization settings

#### Issue: High defect rate after optimization
- **Cause**: Conflict between optimization goals and project constraints
- **Solution**: Review project constraints and adjust optimization parameters

#### Issue: Delays in the optimization process
- **Cause**: High project complexity or computational resource issues
- **Solution**: Check available resources or try optimizing smaller parts of the project

#### Issue: Unexpected recommendations
- **Cause**: Mismatch between AI model and project specifics
- **Solution**: Check input data and constraints. Report the issue to the development team

#### Issue: Errors exporting results
- **Cause**: File format issues or access permissions
- **Solution**: Check access permissions and try a different export format
