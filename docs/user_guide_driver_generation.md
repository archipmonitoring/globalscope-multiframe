- **Bootloaders**: System initialization code

### Target Platforms
Drivers can be generated for multiple platforms:
- Linux kernel modules
- Windows device drivers
- Android HAL interfaces
- iOS driver frameworks
- Real-time operating systems (RTOS)
- Bare metal embedded systems

- **Optimization Suggestions**: AI-driven performance improvement recommendations
- **Resource Usage Reports**: Detailed resource consumption analysis

## Best Practices

### Driver Design Guidelines
1. Clearly define interface specifications before generation
2. Choose appropriate target platforms and driver types
3. Balance performance requirements with resource constraints
4. Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
5. Follow industry standards and coding best practices

### Generation Process
1. Start with simple drivers and gradually increase complexity
2. Validate generated code against reference implementations
3. Perform thorough testing on target platforms
4. Document all customizations and modifications
5. Maintain version control for all driver variants

### Testing and Validation
1. Use built-in testing frameworks for initial validation
2. Perform platform-specific testing on actual hardware
3. Validate security features against industry standards
4. Benchmark performance against reference implementations
5. Conduct stress testing under various load conditions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Generated driver fails to compile
- **Cause**: Incompatible target platform or missing dependencies
- **Solution**: Verify platform compatibility and install required dependencies

#### Issue: Driver performance below expectations
- **Cause**: Suboptimal configuration or platform limitations
- **Solution**: Review optimization settings and consider platform-specific alternatives
