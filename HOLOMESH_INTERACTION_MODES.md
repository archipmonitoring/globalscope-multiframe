- **Learning Activation**: Designers can disable confidentiality to enable system evolution

## Implementation Details

### API Endpoints

The new modes are accessible through the v2 API with additional parameters:

```
POST /api/v2/cad/ai/optimize-parameters
```

New parameters:
- `interaction_mode`: "professional" | "innovative" | "semi_automatic" | "manual"
- `confidentiality_enabled`: boolean (default: true)

### Strategy Options

Two new optimization strategies have been added:
- `semi_automatic`: Combines AI with HoloMesh recommendations
- `manual`: Provides professional tool guidance

## Benefits

### Semi-Automatic Mode Benefits:
1. **Seamless Tool Integration**: Work with multiple tools through HoloMesh without direct interaction
2. **Error Reduction**: Eliminates human factors that cause mistakes
3. **Enhanced Productivity**: Switch between tools effortlessly
4. **Breakthrough Potential**: Enables innovative approaches to CAD optimization

### Manual Mode Benefits:
1. **Professional Guidance**: HoloMesh provides expert recommendations
2. **Privacy Protection**: Confidentiality mode keeps designer work private
3. **Flexible Learning**: Option to enable system learning when desired
4. **Non-intrusive Support**: Guidance without interfering with creative process

## Usage Examples

  "project_id": "project_456",
  "initial_params": {
    "placer": "heap",
    "timing_driven": true
  },
  "target_metrics": {
    "resource_efficiency": 0.9,
    "quality_score": 0.85
  },
  "strategy": "manual",
  "interaction_mode": "manual",
  "confidentiality_enabled": true
}
```
