# HoloMesh Marketplace System Guide

## Overview

The HoloMesh Marketplace is a comprehensive system for trading chip designs with NFT integration and ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof) protection. Every chip created with HoloMesh and sent for production is automatically published in the marketplace together with an NFT. Source code files sent to the factory are protected by ZKP without disclosure.

## Features

### 1. Automatic Chip Publishing
- All chips created through HoloMesh are automatically added to the marketplace
- Each chip is associated with an NFT for ownership verification
- Source code is protected using ZKP technology

### 2. Royalty Distribution System
- Payment percentage equals the number of IP blocks in the chip
- Royalties are automatically distributed to designers who created those IP blocks
- Transparent tracking of all royalty payments

### 3. NFT Integration
- Each chip is represented by a unique NFT
- Ownership verification through blockchain technology
- Immutable record of chip design history

### 4. ZKP Protection
- Zero-Knowledge Proof technology protects source code
- Factory receives only verified computations without exposing actual code
- Maintains confidentiality while ensuring integrity

## Technical Implementation

### Backend API Endpoints

#### Publish Chip
```
POST /api/marketplace/publish
```
Publishes a chip to the marketplace with NFT creation and ZKP protection.

#### Get Marketplace Chips
```
GET /api/marketplace/chips
```

#### Purchase Chip
```
POST /api/marketplace/purchase
```
Processes chip purchase and distributes royalties.

#### Get Marketplace Statistics
```
GET /api/marketplace/stats
```
Retrieves marketplace statistics including total revenue and royalties.

### Frontend Components

Displays all available chips in a grid layout with search and filtering capabilities.

#### Chip Cards
Individual chip representations showing:
- Chip name and designer
- Price and royalty percentage
- Number of IP blocks
- ZKP protection status
- Purchase and details buttons

#### Publish Dialog
Form for publishing new chips to the marketplace with fields for:
- Chip name and description
- Price and royalty percentage
- Number of IP blocks
- ZKP protection toggle

#### Chip Details Dialog
Detailed view of chip information including:
- Full description

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Chip Creation
1. User creates a chip design using HoloMesh
2. Upon completion, chip is automatically published to marketplace
3. System generates NFT for the chip
4. Source code is prepared for ZKP protection

### 2. Marketplace Browsing
1. Users can view all available chips in the marketplace
2. Filter chips by price, designer, or IP blocks
3. View detailed information about each chip

### 3. Chip Purchase
1. User selects a chip to purchase
2. System processes payment
3. Royalties are automatically calculated and distributed
4. Factory receives ZKP-protected source code

### 4. Royalty Distribution
1. System calculates royalties based on IP blocks
2. Distributes payments to original IP block creators
3. Maintains transparent record of all transactions

## Security Features

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Protection
- Source code remains confidential
- Factory receives only verified computations
- Mathematical proof of code correctness without exposure

### NFT Ownership Verification
- Blockchain-based ownership records
- Immutable history of chip transactions
- Protection against counterfeiting

### Secure Transactions
- Encrypted payment processing
- Transparent royalty distribution
- Audit trail for all marketplace activities

## Integration with HoloMesh

The marketplace system is fully integrated with the HoloMesh ecosystem:
